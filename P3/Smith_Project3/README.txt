SUMMARY:

This is my implementation of a GUI for clasp using Python 3.6.

HOw TO USE: 

In order to run the program, just press run. The GUI is prepopulated with the input file I used for testing. 

To use a different file or input, delete the prepoluated input and either type the new test case, or upload from a file

OUTPUT: 

The program shows that everything has been translated into the format clasp asks for, and it runs "clasp 0" with the input
to show that the output given from the constraints, but I didn't understand what was expected for the rest of the project, so 
I stopped there.
